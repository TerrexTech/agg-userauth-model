User Aggregate-model
---

This repository contains the model for **User** aggregate.

The intention is to use this for sanitizing input, such as when querying a database, the extra/unwanted fields will be removed. Otherwise this, although can be used, is not intended to be universal reference for User, every service must handle its own user-representation.
